# About UHvibe

University of Hawaii has 10 campuses and additional educational and research facilities across the State of Hawaii. Thus, the community is very large and diverse. Unfortunately, there are very little ways to find and connect with others based on their music 'vibe'. UHvibe offers a way to overcome these issues.

[UHvibe](http://uhvibe.meteorapp.com/) is a Meteor application that is designed to help the University of Hawaii community find and connect with others based on their music interests and skills.

# Feedback

##Good

The design looks great.

All the basic functions are available.

The app was simple to navigate.

A.E.:
The color choice for the design is really good.

The various functions are great.

##Bad/Improvements

C.B.: 
You could add more customization in the user's profile

Show the whole conversation (the message chain)

On the homepage, you can have notifications of messages or possibly some other reason, such as an event that is happening in Hawaii that might interest you.

Create groups and allow users to possibly comment and send puclic messages within the group

A.E.:
Maybe add some slack-like channels for a group of users

Could have users follow or add other users (a friend system)

##Overall

C.B.: 
Expected something bland, but it was cool.

A.E.:
Overall, it was really good. I didn't expect it to be that good.
