# About UHvibe

The University of Hawaii System has 10 campuses and additonal educational and research centers across the State of Hawaii. Although University of Hawaii has a large and diverse community, there are very little ways to find and connect with others based on their music 'vibe'. UHvibe offers a way to overcome these issues.

UHvibe is a Meteor application that is designed to help the University of Hawaii community find and connect with others based on their music interests/skills.
