# About UHvibe

University of Hawaii has 10 campuses and additional educational and research facilities across the State of Hawaii. Thus, the community is very large and diverse. Unfortunately, there are very little ways to find and connect with others based on their music 'vibe'. UHvibe offers a way to overcome these issues.

[UHvibe](http://uhvibe.meteorapp.com/) is a Meteor application that is designed to help the University of Hawaii community find and connect with others based on their music interests and skills. 

# Installation

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, [download a copy of UHvibe](https://github.com/UHvibe/UHvibe/archive/master.zip), or clone it using git.
  
Third, cd into the app/ directory and install libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

Fourth, run the system with:

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

If done correctly, the application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you have an account on the UH test CAS server, you can login.
